# Smart-Home-Environment
This is my EE-212 Microprocessor Course Project, I used two FRDM-KL25Z boards to implement this project. I used one of the board as transmitter board and one of the board as receiver board. Transmitter board takes the datas from sensors which are HCSR04(distance sensor), servo motor, light sensor, DHT11(humidity and temperature sensor) and then send these datas to the receiver board via using HC05 bluetooth module. There is an LCD in the receiver board and you can see the informations which come from the transmitter board instantaneous. If the distance sensor is activated, it starts to control whether an intruder comes or not. If it detects an intruder, servo motor locks the door immediately. Also, if the fire becomes 40 celcius or more, the fire alarm will be activated.
